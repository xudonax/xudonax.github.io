            Hi there! I'm Fluffy, and I go by they/them pronouns.
            During work hours I'm doing a mix of C# and Azure DevOps.
            To relax, I either play some video games or go on long
            walks in the countryside. Lately, I've been playing Forza
            a lot. Both Forza Horizon 5 for some relaxation, and Forza
            Motorsport 7 for some challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Around 2018 I was introduced to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th
            edition. First as player, and later as Dungeon Master. With
            a few friends I've recently completed the Dragon of Icespire
            Peak adventure. And because we all enjoyed that, we're now
            going through another adventure. This time we've picked
            Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage. This is a huge adventure,
            and we'll probably be playing it for a long time before we
            reach the end of the book.
