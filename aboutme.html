        Hi there! I'm Fluffy, and I go by they/them pronouns.
        During work hours I'm doing a mix of C# and Azure DevOps.
        To relax, I either play some video games or go on long
        walks in the countryside. Lately, I've been playing Forza
        a lot. Both Forza Horizon 5 for some relaxation, and Forza
        Motorsport 7 for some challenges.

        Around 2018 I was introduced to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th
        edition. First as player, and later as Dungeon Master. With
        a few friends I've recently completed the Dragon of Icespire
        Peak adventure. And because we all enjoyed that, we're now
        going through another adventure. This time we've picked
        Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage. This is a huge adventure,
        and we'll probably be playing it for a long time before we
        reach the end of the book.
